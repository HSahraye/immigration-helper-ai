## Agent Training Process

### Fine-Tuning Approach

Each agent is trained using OpenAI's fine-tuning capabilities:

1. **Base Model Selection**
   - Starting with GPT-3.5-Turbo or GPT-4 as the base model
   - Selecting the appropriate model based on complexity and requirements

2. **Training Data Preparation**
   - Converting structured data to fine-tuning format
   - Creating question-answer pairs
   - Developing comprehensive system prompts

3. **Fine-Tuning Process**
   - Submitting training data to OpenAI's fine-tuning API
   - Monitoring training progress
   - Evaluating model performance

4. **Model Deployment**
   - Integrating fine-tuned models with the platform
   - Setting up appropriate API endpoints
   - Configuring system prompts and parameters

### System Prompts

Each agent uses a specialized system prompt that includes:

1. **Role Definition**
   - Clear definition of the agent's specialization
   - Scope of expertise
   - Limitations and boundaries

2. **Knowledge Base Reference**
   - References to the types of information the agent has been trained on
   - Examples of processes and questions it can address

3. **Response Guidelines**

## Testing the Agents

After training your agents, it's important to test them to ensure they're working correctly. The project includes two testing scripts:

### Testing the OpenAI API Connection

To test if your OpenAI API key is working correctly:

```bash
npm run test:openai
```

This will attempt to connect to the OpenAI API using your key and display the results. A successful connection will show "OpenAI API connection successful!" in the output.

### Testing the Trained Agents

To test all trained agents with sample questions:

```bash
npm run test:agents
```

This script will:
1. Load each trained agent from the `data/agents` directory
2. Send a relevant test question to each agent
3. Display the agent's response

If any agent fails to respond or produces errors, you may need to retrain that agent or check your OpenAI API key.

## Common Issues

### OpenAI API Key Not Found

If you encounter an error like this:

```
OpenAIError: The OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is missing or empty
```

Make sure you have:

1. Created a `.env` file in the root directory with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

2. Recompiled the scripts after making changes:
   ```bash
   npm run build:scripts
   ```

3. If the issue persists, you can set the API key directly in your environment before running the training:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   npm run train
   ```

#### TypeScript Module Error

If you encounter an error like this when running the training scripts:

```
TypeError: Unknown file extension ".ts" for /path/to/script.ts
```

This is due to a conflict between the ESM module system used by Next.js and the CommonJS module system expected by ts-node. To fix this:

1. Use the provided npm scripts which compile TypeScript to JavaScript before running:
   ```bash
   npm run train
   ```

2. If you need to run the scripts manually, first compile them and then run the JavaScript versions:
   ```bash
   npm run build:scripts
   node dist/scripts/runTrainingPipeline.js
   ```

3. For development purposes, you can also use ts-node with the correct tsconfig:
   ```bash
   npx ts-node -P tsconfig.scripts.json scripts/runTrainingPipeline.ts
   ```
   Note: This approach may still fail in some environments due to module system conflicts.

#### OpenAI API Rate Limits

If you encounter rate limit errors from the OpenAI API:

1. Increase the delay between API calls in the scripts
2. Split the training process across multiple days
3. Consider upgrading your OpenAI API plan for higher rate limits

#### Data Collection Issues

If web scraping fails to collect sufficient data:

1. Check if the website structure has changed
2. Try alternative official sources
3. Consider manual data collection for critical information
